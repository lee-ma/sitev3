    <h1>Hi, I'm Lee ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p className="text">
      I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, originally from Calgary, Alberta.
      I will be a SWE Intern at Facebook (Instagram) this Fall.
      At UW, I was an executive member of the <a href="https://entsoc.ca">Entrepreneurship Society</a>, 
      a Project Developer with <a href="https://uwblueprint.org"> UW Blueprint</a>,
      and the developer of the 2019 <a href="http://enghack.com">EngHack website</a>, a MLH hackathon that received 600+ applications.
      Outside of school I love any outdoor activity in the mountains, spicy food, and going to Costco for soft serve.
