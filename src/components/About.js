    <h1>Hi, I'm Lee,</h1>
    <p className="text">
      I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, originally from Calgary, Alberta.
      At school, I am an executive member of the <a href="https://entsoc.ca">Entrepreneurship Society</a>,&nbsp;
      and I was the sole developer of the 2019 <a href="http://enghack.com">EngHack website</a>, a MLH hackathon that received 560+ applications.
      Outside of school I love any outdoor activity in the mountains, learning to cook new recipes, and going to Costco for soft serve.
